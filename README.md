Emoji (絵文字?) is the Japanese term for the picture characters or emoticons used in Japanese electronic messages and webpages ([read more about it's history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji)). 

You can use emoji in GitHub issues, markdown files, pull requests, commit messages... basically almost anywhere you see a textfield.

To include an emoji inline simply wrap it's name in colons e.g. writing `:thumbsup:` will display a :thumbsup:
