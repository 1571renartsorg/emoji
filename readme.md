Emoji (絵文字) is the Japanese term for the picture characters or emoticons used in Japanese electronic messages and webpages ([read more about its history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji)). You can use emoji in GitHub issues, markdown files, pull requests, commit messages... basically almost anywhere you see a textfield.

To include an emoji inline simply wrap its name in colons e.g. writing `:thumbsup:` will display a :thumbsup:

You can see all the emoji that GitHub supports above :point_up:

Have fun! :tada:
